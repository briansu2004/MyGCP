My GCP


## My GCP projects

- Designed, developed, deployed and managed Microservices with Node.js and Java RESTful APIs in GCP for a large Telecommunication company
    - Built new REST APIs with Node.js and Java to talk with downstream APIs and serve for upstream applications.
    - Leveraged Redis to provide caching and programmed the refresh schedule jobs (bulk deleting hash and set keys).
    - Mocked APIs with Mockoon and nock during the development.
    - Automated the build and test processes with GitHub repo, triggers, schedulers and Cloud Builds.
    - Deployed with Cloud build YAML files, GKE Kubernetes, pods, Helm and Docker file to achieve auto scaling.
    - Implemented CI/CD pipelines with Spinnaker, Jenkins, Groovy and Terraform.
    - Monitored API performance with Google Cloud stack driver dashboard and alert policies.
    - Implemented immutable infrasture with Terraform scripts and pull requests.
    - Conducted performance testing with JMeter.

- Designed and implemented Cloud functions and CI/CD data pipelines in Google Cloud for a large multinational company
    - Programmed cloud functions in Golang and Python.
    - Configured one cloud function to monitor incoming Pub/Sub messages then save to BigQuery, another cloud function to archive data from BigQuery to GCS bucket in avro format with Cloud Schedule.
    - Created unit tests with mock and integration tests for test coverage; 
    - Built a stress testing multi-threading tool for performance benchmark and adjusted Cloud Function configuration.
    - Managed all GCP infrastructure as code with Terraform scripts, parameterized all cloud functions, automated everything and enabled auto-scaling.
    - Designed and built the CI/CD pipelines with Cloud Source Repository, Cloud Build and GCP Container Registry with Docker and YAML; set up the triggers for the test pipelines and prod pipeline; configured multiple test pipelines can run concurrently.
    - Worked on Dataflow pipelines with Apache Beam SDK for Java and Maven.
    - Handed over high quality detailed runbook documentation

- Designed solutions to migrate on premise applications to GCP for a large pharmacy client
    - Discussed with business owners and other vendors to plan the detailed runbook and matrices in both high level and low level.
    - Moved all Informatica applications (MDM, WildFly, EDC, IDQ, AXON) from on premise to Cloud (OpenShift and Google Cloud Platform) and NoSQL BigQuery migration.

- Created many Data Science and Machine Learning POCs with GCP Machine Learning APIs (NLP, Cloud Vision, DialogFlow etc.), Jupyter Notebook and Python.


Exercises and practice:

- Hands-on labs with Qwiklabs.
